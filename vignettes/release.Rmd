# Releasing a new version of ggplot2

## Release candidate phase

After issues resolved for a given release:

1.  Pass R CMD check.

1.  In DESCRIPTION and NEWS, remove the .99 version suffix and increment the
    version number. For example, 0.9.2.99 becomes 0.9.3.

1.  Do the same for any packages that ggplot2 depends on, such as scales and
    gtable.

1.  Update ggplot2's Import dependency versions to use the final release numbers
    of scales and gtable.

1.  Commit these changes to a branch with `ggplot2-<version>-rc`, and push the
    branch.

1.  Email ggplot2, ggplot2-dev, and the maintainers of packages that depend on
    ggplot2.

1.  Check packages that depend on ggplot2 with `devtools::revdep_check()`

If problems arise during the RC period, make fixes on the branch. Those fixes
later get merged back into master.

## Release

When the package is accepted on CRAN:

1.  Create a new release at https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/releases.
    The tag name should be of the form `v1.0.0`.

1.  If any Check out the new branch, or merge it into master. (Need to get off the
    rc branch so it can be deleted):

    ```
    VERSION=1.0.0
    git checkout v$VERSION
    # Or
    git checkout master
    git merge v$VERSION
    ```

1.  Delete the `-rc` branch, with:

    ```
    git branch -d v$VERSION-rc
    git push origin :v$VERSION-rc
    ```

1.  Once you push the tag github, travis will automatically build the website.
